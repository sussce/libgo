#Key Features of Go AI Engine

    Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS):
        Use MCTS for decision-making, integrating neural network evaluations for policy and value predictions.
        Support exploration and exploitation adjustments for varying levels of play (e.g., from beginner to professional level).

    Neural Network Evaluation:
        Implement a deep neural network to predict policy (move probabilities) and value (win probabilities).
        Use techniques like residual networks, self-play training, and reinforcement learning to improve the model.

    Game Analysis:
        Provide post-game analysis, identifying mistakes, best moves, and win rates throughout the game.
        Estimate and visualize ownership, territory, and influence.

    Support for Different Rulesets:
        Implement support for various Go rulesets (Japanese, Chinese, Korean, etc.), including different scoring methods and rules for ko and seki.

    Scalability and Performance:
        Allow for scaling across multiple GPUs for faster processing.
        Optimize for both speed and accuracy, balancing resource usage with the quality of decisions.

    Configurable Playouts and Simulations:
        Allow users to configure the number of playouts or simulations per move, adjusting the engine’s strength and computation time.
        Support for various MCTS configurations (e.g., UCT, PUCT).

    Time Management:
        Implement effective time management for real-time play, including byo-yomi, Canadian overtime, and Fischer timing.

    Self-Play and Training:
        Support self-play for training purposes, where the engine can generate training data and improve its neural network.
        Implement features for self-training with reinforcement learning, like KataGo’s continuous improvement pipeline.

    Move Prediction and Variation Exploration:
        Allow users to explore alternative move sequences (variations) and predict outcomes for each.

    Integration with Go Servers and GUIs:
        Provide APIs or plugins for integration with popular Go servers (KGS, OGS) and GUIs (Lizzie, Sabaki).
        Support for SGF file format for game records, including saving and loading.
